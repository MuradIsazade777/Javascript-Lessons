# Variables in JavaScript

In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. You can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

Key Points

let: block-scoped, can be reassigned.

const: block-scoped, cannot be reassigned.

var: function-scoped, avoid using in modern JS.

## Examples

```js
let name = "John";
const age = 25;
var country = "Azerbaijan";

console.log(name, age, country);
